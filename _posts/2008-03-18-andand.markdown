I really, really like [andand](https://github.com/raganwald/andand). Try it and stop repeating yourself.

I mean, why would you want to write this:

{% highlight ruby %}
entry.at('description') && entry.at('description').inner_text
{% endhighlight %}

when you can write this:

{% highlight ruby %}
entry.at('description').andand.inner_text
{% endhighlight %}
