Did you know that Ruby was Matz’ *eleventh* take on creating a programming language? Listen. So don't despare next time you fail, you are right on track.

> I sat down and counted the other day and Ruby was eleventh language I've tried to write. Out of those 4 only had names, 3 of them didn't work at all… the rest of them was just experiments. Ruby is the only one that really worked, so I guess that makes Ruby the first one, but it was one out of eleven attempts.
