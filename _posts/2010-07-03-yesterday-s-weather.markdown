[Pomodoro Technique Illustrated Book](https://sivers.org/book/Pomodoro):

> A national weather service spent a gigantic amount of money on a new forecast system. All the emerging technology was included, and it had an accuracy rate of almost 70 percent.

> Then a clever person challenged the super machine with a much simpler algorithm. It was called Yesterday’s Weather, and it said, “Tomorrow will be like today.” Guess what? It had the same accuracy as the super machine.
